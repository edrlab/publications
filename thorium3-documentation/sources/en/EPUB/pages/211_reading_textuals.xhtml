    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <p>Thorium provides visual reading and audio playback.
In order to ensure that you can find your way around the
the publication, Thorium also offers many navigation options as well as
the possibility to add bookmarks or to search within the publication.</p>

<p>Reading functionalities are very different from one format to another. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading Textual first publications like reflowable EPUB and textual or full Daisy will allow for the greatest number of functionalities.</li>
  <li>Visual first publications like Fixed Layout EPUBS and Divina will not allow personalization of texts.</li>
  <li>Audio publications have a significative different reading interface as no text is displayed.</li>
  <li>PDF support is basic and provides few options. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Zooming on images</h2>
<p>Thorium has an image zoom feature (epub only).</p>
<p>To zoom on an image you can select the image (a magenta focus outline will appear around it) and activate zoom by clicking with the mouse or tapping it with the finger. Access to image zoom via keyboard is currently not possible.</p>
<p>If the image is also a link or if the book your read is in a fixed layout format, you will need to hit the 
  <kbd>Shift</kbd> key in order to enter the image zoom feature.
</p>
<p>To zoom in or out, tab to the 
  <code>+</code> or 
  <code>-</code> buttons and hit 
  <kbd>enter</kbd>, use mouse wheel, scroll up and down or pinch and stretch trackpad or onscreen touch gestures.
</p>
<p>Once the image is zoomed you can move vertically and horizontally with 
  <kbd>Left arrow</kbd>, 
  <kbd>Right arrow</kbd>, 
  <kbd>Left arrow</kbd> and 
  <kbd>Right arrow</kbd>, by moving mouse while maintaining clic, with usual trackpad gestures or with finger moves on tactile screens.
</p>
<p>To close the image zoom view and to return to the reading view, press 
  <kbd>ESC</kbd> key, or the X button.
</p>
<p>Some restrictions due to ebook design may apply, for example when images are inserted as style (CSS), it is not possible to open the image view for zooming.</p>

<h2>Reading settings</h2>
<p>In the reading interface use the 
  <code>Preferences</code> button (
  <img class="icons" src="../resources/images/icons3/textarea-icon.svg" alt=""/>): the options are revealed.
</p>
<div class="info">
Reading settings can be saved or reset by using buttons <span class="ui_button">Save</span> and <span class="ui_button">Reset</span> located in the menu <span class="ui_button">Settings</span>, submenu <span class="ui_button">Configuration</span> of the Reading window.
</div>
<p>Major settings are available for EPUB Reflowable, Fixed Layout EPUBs and PDF formats just don't allow personalisation of appearance. Most Fixed Layout EPUBs will allow to open Image view for zooming on a page. PDFs can be enlarged using the Zoom sub-menu in the Preferences panel.</p>
<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>The color of the background and foreground can be changed using one of the three
available themes - Neutral, Sepia and Night.</p>
<h2>Text</h2>
<p>The font size can be increased or decreased using the slider.
The font can also be changed. The available options are as follows
Default, Old style, Modern, Sans, Humanist, Readable (Dyslexia),
Dualspace and Monospace.</p>
<p>By selecting the 
  <code>...</code> you can enter the name of the font you want to use.
To do this, the font must be present on your
operating system and you must know its exact name as it is set for
the operating system.

<div class="info">
Thorium uses the voices from the computer's operating system, in combination with the language information provided by the book. If you experience problems please check the related FAQ entry [I can't select the adequate voice for read aloud function (TTS)](../400_ressources/430_faq.xhtml#TTSvoices).
</div>

<h2>Text to Speech (TTS)</h2>
<div class="danger">
  <p>Thorium 2.3 TTS reads page numbers by default which might result in a too verbose earing experience. The 
    <code>skipability</code> option in 
    <code>readaloud</code> parameter does not affect TTS reading as expected. This is fixed in 
    <a href="https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/releases">2.4 alpha continuous test build</a> and will be shipped in 2.4 release.
  </p>
</div>
<p>Text-to-speech is launched using the speaker button in the middle of the toolbar,
or by using the keyboard shortcut 
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + 
  <kbd>2</kbd>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Play and pause can be controlled with the keyboard shortcut

      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + 
      <kbd>2</kbd>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The playback position can be moved with 
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + 
      <kbd>1</kbd>
and 
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + 
      <kbd>3</kbd> for previous and next respectively.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A speed control is available when read aloud
is selected, with a range from x0.5 to x2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current sentence is highlighted in light yellow, and each word spoken is
underlined in orange.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An alternative (simplified) view of the publication is provided through
options available in the 
      <code>Settings / Readaloud</code> menu.
