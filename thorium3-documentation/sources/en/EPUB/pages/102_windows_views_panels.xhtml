      <h3 id="catalog_view">Catalogs View</h3>
      <p>This is the place where you can store, access, browse online catalogs and acquire or borrow ebooks from them. At first this place will sound empty because we do not preload any catalog.

      <p>Two catalogs protocoles are available.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://opds.io/"><abbr title="Open Protocole Distribution System">OPDS</abbr></a>, a standard format to display catalog on the Web. Thorium can provide access to OPDS 1 and 2 catalogs.</li> 
        <li>French public libraries machine-readable catalog (similar to OPDS but not identical).</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Setting up a french public library account</h4>
        <p>In France, many public libraries provide a machine-readable catalog (similar to OPDS but not identical), letting patrons download digital publications from their personal bookshelf. Integrating this technology in Thorium Reader allows you to download an ebook or audiobook directly into Thorium Reader for instant reading.</p>
        <p>To connect your French public library account, enter a French city ('Montpellier') or part of the library name in the Search field and hit the Search button. A list of public libraries corresponding to your search will appear. Select a library and hit Add. In the updated list of catalogs, select this library: an authentication form is displayed. Enter your username/email address and password, and hit Login. You can now see the content of your personal bookshelf, from which you can download and read the ebooks and audiobooks you previously borrowed.</p>

          <h4>Setting up an OPDS account</h4>
          <p>Select the `Catalogs` tab then the button `+ Add an OPDS feed`. Indicate a Name to designate this catalog and paste an address corresponding to a catalog distributed in OPDS format. Validate with the button `Add`.</p>
        <p>Example :</p>
        <p>Activating the following link will download a .atom file that can be opened with Thorium:  
        <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search.opds/" target="_blank">Download OPDS feed for Gutenberg.org new titles</a>
        </p>
        <p>It is also possible to use context menu (usually Right clic), Copy this link and paste it into Thorium Add an OPDS panel
  to see the magic happen.</p>
        <p>OPDS feeds can also be provided as direct links which should open directly in Thorium. 
          <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search.opds/" target="_blank">Open OPDS feed for Gutenberg.org new titles</a>
        </p>
        <p>Since Thorium 2.2, OPDS feeds can be edited so you can change the name or retrieve feed URL.</p>
